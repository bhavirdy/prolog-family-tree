# Prolog Family Tree

This project implements a family tree using Prolog. It defines relationships such as parent, sibling, spouse, and more, allowing queries about family connections.

## Usage

1. Install a Prolog interpreter such as [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
2. Load the `family_tree.pl` file in the Prolog interpreter:
   ```prolog
   ?- [family_tree].
3. Query relationships. For example:
    ```prolog
   ?- mother(X, greg).
